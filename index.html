    <h3>Use Strong Passwords</h3>
    <p>Protecting your online accounts is crucial. Think of your passwords as keys to your digital life – keep them secure!</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Don't share your passwords or leave them exposed. Use a unique, strong password for every account, and change them regularly.</li>
        <li>Consider a password manager to create and store individual, complex passwords for you. Many popular devices and providers offer them.</li>
        <li>Make your passwords tough to crack:
            <ul>
                <li>At least 10 characters long.</li>
                <li>Mix letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
                <li>Be unpredictable – avoid names, birthdays, or common words.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Never reuse passwords. If one account is compromised, all your others could be too.</li>
        <li>Legitimate companies won't ask for your password via phone, text, or email. If they do, it's a scam.</li>
        <li>Always keep your passwords in a secure, hidden place.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Enable Multifactor Authentication </h3>
    <p>Think of multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an extra lock on your digital doors. Instead of just a password, MFA uses at least one more way to verify it's really you. This could be a code sent to your phone, a fingerprint scan, or even facial recognition. Adding these extra layers makes it much harder for cybercriminals to break into your accounts, even if they manage to get your password.</p>

    <h3>Only Share Personal Info on Secure Websites</h3>
    <p>When you're online shopping or banking, only enter personal information on websites that use encryption.<br><br>How to tell if a site is secure: Look for "https://" at the start of the web address. The "s" means it's secure.<br><br>Always check for "https://" on every page where you enter or view personal data, not just the login page. If any part of your session isn't encrypted, your account could be vulnerable.</p>

    <h3>Maintain Device Security</h3>
    <p>For online banking or shopping, **security software is a must**. This includes antivirus, anti-spam, and spyware detection. Keep this software **updated automatically**.<br><br>
        Install **security updates** on all your devices as soon as you get notifications. Check your computer and software provider's websites for more security tips.<br><br>
        If you're using **cloud storage for personal financial information**, do your homework. Ensure the provider uses **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** and **data encryption**. Read their terms of service carefully, including all costs, before agreeing.</p>

    <h3>Click smart.</h3>
    <p>The best way to protect yourself from bad links is to **not click them**. Even if a link looks real, it's safest to avoid it.<br><br>
        Instead of clicking a suspicious link, replying to a strange email, or opening an attachment from someone you don't know, **go directly to the company's official website or app** to check the information. Clicking on fake messages can put malware on your device or expose your personal info.</p>
